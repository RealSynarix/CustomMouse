**Cobalt-X Zero** is a high-performance, bare-metal engineering project designed to pro that 'elite' gaming peripherals doesn't need bloated, proprietary software. In doing so even if it doesn't have fancy 8000hz polling rate or wireless design, it still outperforms 'god gaming mice' for a fraction of the cost. Engineered from the ground up to challenge industry standards of latency, weight, and customization, this project represents 3 months of self-taught development in PCB design and firmware architecture.

## Technical Details & Performance
Most "pro" mice rely on software tricks and marketing, while the Cobalt-X Zero relies on pure performance with no software bloat or a mass marketing gimick.

* **Internal 32kHz Oversampling:** While the USB polls at 1000Hz, the **STM32G4** (170MHz) polls the **PMW3360** sensor at 32,000Hz internally. This allows for advanced hardware-level jitter filtering and superior motion smoothness.
* **DMA-Driven Pipeline:** Implemented Direct Memory Access (DMA) to handle sensor data transfer, bypassing CPU interrupts to ensure the processor is 100% focused on packets and the macro.
* **Eager Debounce Algorithm:** Unlike standard mice that wait ~5ms to verify a click, Cobalt-X triggers on the initial falling edge of the signal for **sub-ms click latency**.
* **Predictive Packet Readiness:** HID packets are formatted and buffered in advance of the USB/OS request, ensuring data is delivered instantly from the buffer.

## Key Features
* **Zero-Software Config (VFS):** Hold the Macro button on plug-in to mount a **67MB Virtual Drive**. Edit `config.ini` directly to change DPI, Polling, and LOD without Windows-only bloatware.
* **'ENTER WEIGHT HERE'g Ultra-Lightweight:** Engineered on a **1.2mm FR4 PCB** providing a ~25% weight reduction compared to standard 1.6mm boards while maintaining structural integrity.
* **Hotswap USB-C:** A true modular interface allowing for custom paracord cables to reduce e-waste and achieve a "wireless" feel.
* **Superior Firmware:** One main reason this mouse is better is the firmware. Like it's depicted above, the firmware is not only superior in every way, but also is under 1KB.
* **HyprX Hardware Macros:** A dedicated hardware toggle that maps the **TTC Gold 24-step encoder** to rapid-fire LMB/RMB actions with real-time neon red LED feedback.

## Open Source & Licensing
This project is built to empower the community through transparency and accessibility. It stands as a testament to the power of self-taught engineering, bridging the gap between digital programming and physical hardware to outperform multi-million/billion dollar corporations through bare-metal efficiency.

I chose licenses that allow this to be open source while keeping this mine and not anyone elses. You are free to remix, edit, and share, provided you credit me and distribute contributions under the same licenses.
